# Test Flight :: Change log

* 2014-1228: 0.1.0 (jwvanderbeck) for KSP 1.0.2 PRE-RELEASE
	+ Very first public alpha release of TestFlight.  Some things to note:
		- Future versions will break save games.  Don't install this in a save you care about
		- There are bound to be tons of bugs.  Please report them using the issue tracker on GitHub
		- Contains only a small amount of failure modules.  More will be added in the future
		- There is no in game UI for changing the settings.  That can currently only be done by hand editing the settings.cfg file.  Obviously a UI will be added in the future
		- There are two major modes of operation - All Vessels, and Active Vessel Only.  Active Vessel Only is the only mode that has received any testing at this point.
		- Configs are included to add the TestFlight system to some of the Squad engines and fuel tanks.  More parts can be included if you desire by making your own configs.  In the future more parts will be included.
		- The included ZIP file contains some extraneous Mac OSX files.  Sorry about that, but at the time of this release only my Mac was available.  I'll clean this up for future releases.
		- At this time I have only tested KSP under Mac OSX.  The included files should work for any build of course, but no testing on other platforms has been done.
